# Derivative Calculator

## Project Overview

This is a C++ project developed for the Introduction to Programming class. The application features a graphical user interface (GUI) designed to compute the first and second derivatives of complex mathematical expressions, including their corresponding derivative trees. The project demonstrates the application of basic programming concepts and algorithms, as well as the integration of GUI design in C++.

The primary goal of the project is to provide an intuitive tool for users to calculate derivatives of mathematical functions while visualizing the differentiation process through tree structures.

## Features

* **Graphical Interface**: The application provides a user-friendly graphical interface, built using C++. Users can input mathematical expressions and immediately view their derivatives.

* **First and Second Derivatives**: The core functionality of the tool allows users to compute both the first and second derivatives of a given mathematical expression. The results are displayed in a clear format, helping users understand the differentiation process.

* **Derivative Trees**: Along with the derivatives, the application also visualizes the structure of the differentiation process through derivative trees, which show the breakdown of each operation performed during the calculation.

* **Dark/Light Mode**: Users can toggle between dark mode and light mode for improved accessibility and a personalized user experience.

* **Multilingual Support**: The application supports both Romanian (RO) and English (ENG) languages, allowing users to switch between languages according to their preference.

* **User Guide**: A built-in user guide is available to assist users in understanding how to use the application, including instructions on how to input mathematical expressions.
